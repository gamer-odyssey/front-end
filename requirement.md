This also allows the user to see the schedule for future games that are coming up to make plans or write notes of what they plan on doing once the game gets close to release.

3. Why should we care about your product?
- Everyone at some level likes to be entertained, the other thing that everyone can be on board with is having some way to organize their entertainment.

This will have forms and Auth0 as ways to add some user privacy but complexity that makes this truly impressive for any type of gamer.

> **Minimum Viable Product vs What will your MVP functionality be?**
- MVP will be for a user to be able to successfully login to the site using a two be decided auth provider. The user should then be able to search through a list of 10 upcoming video games and be able to add those games to a database if they are interested in the game. Once added the user will be able to edit a notes section if they have any cool info they want to add. The user will also be able to delete these entries if they are not interested in that game.
What are your stretch goals? We would want to find a way to incorporate a calendar that would show the games you have selected instead of a list. We also would be interested in looking to expand the search to include more games if we can find a way to do that. 
> *Stretch*
- What stretch goals are you going to aim for? We would be looking to start with the the calendar and how we go about actually incorporating that in since none of use have done any sort of calendar before.
